## What is Splash ?

Splash is a universal synchronization system of innovative companies!

#### Synchronize all kind of data
Our goal is very simple, connect and synchronize your data between your apps, wherever they are, whatever they are.
Our approach is declarative, that is, it is the servers that you connect that define the data to be synchronized.

#### Fully Universal
Change the way you manage your apps in the cloud! Splash is a data connector unlike any other. Why? It is totally universal!!
Splash system is totally Universal and was not designed for any specific data type. All data types are treated the same way!

#### Synchronize your catalog
Synchronize your product catalog and inventory between multiple merchant sites?
With Splash, it's native. Depending on the application, we even synchronize the attributes and photos of products!

#### Optimize your E-Commerce management
Share your customer data, orders and invoices between all your services?
Splash allows you to repatriate your accounting data on your management tools, it's simple, reliable, and fast.


## What makes Splash really different ?

#### Participative Synchronization
By connecting your applications to Splash, you do not create direct connections between servers, you give them the ability to share their data with your entire network.

#### Automatic Routing
Thanks to the field identification tags, your business data are automatically synchronized with all servers where they are available. No complex configuration, Splash do it for you!

#### More powerful than native webservices
The Splash module is not intended for a single application and can access structured and complex data formats. It provides easy access to all types of data.

#### More efficient
By favoring a "module" approach, Splash does not supplant the rest of the application. This will take care of the specific rules for each application.
